# Case-study--Sentiment-analysis-on-Amazon-Fine-Food-Reviews-
* Applying different Macine Learning Algorithms to analyse sentiment based on Amazon fine food reviews dataset taken from kaggle.com

The purpose of this analysis is to make up a prediction model where we will be able to predict whether a recommendation is positive or negative. In this analysis, we will not focus on the Score, but only the positive/negative sentiment of the recommendation.
To do so, we will work on Amazon's recommendation dataset, we will build a Term-doc incidence matrix using term frequency and inverse document frequency ponderation. When the data is ready, we will load it into predicitve algorithms, mainly na√Øve Bayesian and regression.
In the end, we hope to find a "best" model for predicting the recommendation's sentiment.

## Structure of Repo-
* Every folder contains sub-project in which there is .ipynb, .html, .pdf format of jupyter notebook.
* Each sub_project is itself a distinct machine learning model 
* Some of the sub_project is having model in pickel form which can be used directly
